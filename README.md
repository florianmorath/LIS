# Learning & Intelligent Systems tasks

This repository contains basic machine learning models implemented using scikit-learn.

## Task 1
Regression task (supervised).

Models implemented: Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge Regression, Support Vector Regression with different kernels (rbf, linear, polynomial).

## Task 2
Classification task (supervised).

Models implemented: k Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boost classifier, Logistic Regression classifier, Support Vector Machines.

## Task 3
Classification task (supervised).

Models implemented: Neural network with ReLUs and softmax activation for the last layer.

## Task 4
Classification task (semi-supervised).

Models implemented: Neural network with ReLUs and softmax activation for the last layer. Combined with feature scaling (MinMaxScaler).
